This capstone project shows what data scientists go through in real life when working with real datasets. I assumed the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, using the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting my results to stakeholders. 
I was tasked to predict if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. The cost of a launch can be determined by predicting the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully.
This course is the final course in the IBM Data Science Professional
Certificate as well as the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization.
